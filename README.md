## About
This repositry __aims__ to provide a thorough guide to building drones.
- In case you're new to this domain:
  1. the section Introduction to drones in the documentation provides an execelent
resource for starters who want to __understand__ core concepts related to drones.

  2. after getting familiar with core concepts, you can check the section Code documentation
for thorough explanation of code implementation for Arduino\ESP32 microcontrollers

  3. finally, head to the Building a quadcopter from A to Z section for a thorough guide on building
a drone. (it's not necessary to have the same component used in the guide and source code)

- In case you're just looking for flight controller and\or transmitter source code for Arduino\ESP32:
 - Check Code documention for a thorough source code explanation

- In case you need some guidance on how to build a drone (a quadcopter in particular):
 - Check Building a quadcopter from A to Z section for a thorough guide on how to build a quadcopter


## Having a problem?
